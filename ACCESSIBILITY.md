# Accessibility Guidelines for MomCare

This document outlines the accessibility improvements implemented across the MomCare app to ensure usability for users with disabilities.

## Overview

The MomCare app now includes comprehensive accessibility support following iOS Human Interface Guidelines and WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Implemented Features

### VoiceOver Support
- All UI elements have proper accessibility labels and hints
- Interactive elements include appropriate accessibility traits (`.button`, `.staticText`, `.image`, `.adjustable`)
- Complex UI elements are grouped for better navigation
- Decorative images are marked as `accessibilityHidden(true)`

### Dynamic Type Support
- All text elements use `UIFont.preferredFont(forTextStyle:)` with appropriate text styles
- `adjustsFontForContentSizeCategory = true` is set on all text elements
- Text scales appropriately with user preferences from extra small to accessibility sizes

### Touch Target Accessibility
- All interactive elements meet the minimum 44x44 point touch target requirement
- Button constraints ensure sufficient tap area even with smaller visual elements

### Progress Indicators
- Progress bars include accessibility values showing percentage completion
- Dynamic content updates include accessible value descriptions
- Health data displays provide meaningful context (e.g., "1,234 steps taken today")

## Coverage by Module

### Dashboard Controllers
- ✅ Focus and tip cards with descriptive labels
- ✅ Pregnancy progress information (week, day, trimester)
- ✅ Event cards with date information
- ✅ Diet and exercise progress with detailed stats
- ✅ Profile button with proper labeling

### MoodNest Controllers
- ✅ Mood quotes with accessibility traits
- ✅ Playlist cards with cover art descriptions
- ✅ Music player with comprehensive control labeling
- ✅ Playback controls with state-aware descriptions

### MyPlan Controllers
- ✅ Nutrition tracking with progress values
- ✅ Food items with consumption status
- ✅ Exercise progress with detailed metrics
- ✅ Breathing exercise controls with clear instructions

### SwiftUI Views
- ✅ Terms of service with proper heading structure
- ✅ Food details with grouped nutrient information
- ✅ Exercise progress with accessible statistics
- ✅ Pregnancy tracking with size comparisons
- ✅ Symptom selection with clear options

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Meaningful Labels**: All accessibility labels provide clear, concise descriptions of what the element is or does
2. **Helpful Hints**: Accessibility hints explain what will happen when the user interacts with an element
3. **Appropriate Traits**: Elements use correct accessibility traits to communicate their purpose
4. **Element Grouping**: Related elements are grouped to reduce VoiceOver navigation complexity
5. **State Communication**: Dynamic elements communicate their current state clearly
6. **Context Preservation**: Accessibility descriptions maintain context even when visual information is not available

## Testing Recommendations

### VoiceOver Testing
1. Turn on VoiceOver in Settings > Accessibility > VoiceOver
2. Navigate through each screen using swipe gestures
3. Verify all interactive elements are discoverable and clearly described
4. Test that gestures work as expected (double-tap to activate, etc.)

### Dynamic Type Testing
1. Go to Settings > Accessibility > Display & Text Size > Larger Text
2. Test with various text sizes including accessibility sizes
3. Verify all text remains readable and UI layouts adapt properly
4. Check that no text is truncated or overlapped

### Switch Control Testing
1. Enable Switch Control in Settings > Accessibility > Switch Control
2. Test navigation through all interactive elements
3. Verify all buttons and controls are accessible via switch navigation

## Future Considerations

- Consider implementing voice control support for hands-free operation
- Add support for reduced motion preferences for users sensitive to animations
- Implement high contrast support for users with visual impairments
- Consider adding haptic feedback for important interactions
