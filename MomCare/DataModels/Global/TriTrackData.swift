At this point, there is no baby yet—your body is preparing for ovulation and fertilization. Hormonal signals are initiating the cycle that leads to the release of an egg and thickening of the uterine lining. This is a foundational week for the baby’s eventual development.",
            momTipText: "You may not feel pregnant, but your body is beginning the process. Hormones like estrogen and progesterone begin to fluctuate, preparing the uterus for a possible embryo. You might experience menstrual symptoms like cramping or bleeding, but internally, a fresh start is taking shape. This is a good time to begin prenatal vitamins, especially folic acid, to support healthy fetal development once conception occurs."

The fertilized egg (zygote) contains a full set of DNA that determines the baby’s sex, hair color, eye color, and more. Though still microscopic, this is the actual beginning of new life.",
            momTipText: "You're at the most fertile point in your cycle. Your body releases luteinizing hormone (LH), which triggers ovulation. You may notice an increase in cervical mucus and a slight rise in basal body temperature. Some women feel a slight pain on one side of their abdomen, known as mittelschmerz. This is a crucial time for conception if you're trying to get pregnant."

            babyTipText: "At 36 weeks, your baby is about the size of a honeydew or small watermelon, weighing around 5.8 to 6 pounds (2.6 to 2.7 kg) and measuring about 18.5 to 19 inches (47–48.3 cm) in length. The baby is considered late preterm this week, but by the end of this week, many care providers consider the baby full-term. The lungs are usually developed enough to support breathing outside the womb. Most body systems — including the immune and digestive systems — are fully functional or very close. The baby continues to shed vernix (the creamy protective coating) and lanugo (fine body hair), swallowing both, which will become part of the baby’s first bowel movement (meconium). The baby’s head may begin to engage in the pelvis (a process called lightening), which makes breathing easier but can increase pressure on your bladder.",
            momTipText: "This week marks the beginning of your ninth month, and your body is likely feeling more ready for birth than ever. You may notice that your bump has shifted lower, relieving pressure on your diaphragm but increasing it on your bladder — resulting in more frequent urination. You may feel increased pelvic pressure or even shooting pains down your legs if the baby presses on a nerve. Walking, climbing stairs, and sleeping may all become more difficult. Your care provider might begin weekly internal exams to check for signs of dilation or effacement. It's also possible to experience the loss of your mucus plug or a sudden burst of energy. Many women feel anxious or emotional at this stage. Try to stay calm, focus on rest, and review labor signs and your birth plan again."

            babyTipText: "Your baby is now considered early term, meaning most major organs are mature enough to function independently outside the womb. Your little one weighs about 6.2 to 6.5 pounds (2.8 to 3 kg) and measures about 19 to 19.5 inches (48.3–49.5 cm) long — about the size of a small jackfruit. The baby’s body continues building fat stores, especially around the arms and legs, making the skin look fuller and less wrinkled. The lungs are producing surfactant to help with breathing after birth, and the brain is still developing rapidly — this process continues even after birth. Your baby is also practicing gripping and turning the head side to side. By now, the head may have dropped into your pelvis (if it's a first pregnancy), and most babies are positioned head-down in preparation for delivery. Fingernails may now extend beyond the fingertips, and tiny toenails are fully formed.",
            momTipText: "At week 37, you're officially in the home stretch. Your body is preparing in many visible and invisible ways. You might feel increased pelvic pressure or heaviness as the baby settles lower, making walking and moving around more difficult. Many women experience frequent urination, back pain, difficulty sleeping, and even occasional bursts of energy. You might lose your mucus plug, and Braxton Hicks contractions may become more frequent or intense. Your cervix may begin to dilate and efface (soften and thin out), and your healthcare provider might start performing weekly internal exams. Emotionally, it's common to feel a mix of excitement, nervousness, and impatience. Some moms start experiencing “nesting,” an instinctual drive to clean and prepare the space for the baby. Make sure your hospital bag is ready, your support person is informed, and you know when to call your provider about labor signs."

At this point, all of the baby’s organs, including the lungs, are ready for life outside the womb. The baby continues to gain weight steadily, about half an ounce (15 grams) per day, and is perfecting coordination for life outside, such as sucking, grasping, and responding to sounds. Vernix (the creamy protective coating) continues to shed, and the baby is swallowing amniotic fluid, which becomes part of the first poop — meconium. The baby’s skin is now smooth, the body rounded, and the head may already be engaged in your pelvis, especially if this is your first pregnancy. Most babies are now in the optimal position for delivery, and movements may feel different — more like squirming or stretching than kicks.",
            momTipText: "You may feel like you're on high alert now, watching for every cramp or twinge and wondering if it’s the start of labor. Your belly is stretched to its maximum size, and simple tasks like standing up, bending over, or sleeping comfortably may feel nearly impossible. You may experience increased pelvic pressure, lightning crotch (sharp pelvic zings), more frequent Braxton Hicks contractions, and an increase in vaginal discharge. You could even have some bloody show, a sign your cervix is preparing for labor. You might feel antsy, tired, or very emotional, and your body may be releasing more relaxin, making your joints looser. Try to stay calm, walk often, rest when you can, and continue light stretching or prenatal yoga if you’re comfortable. Avoid comparing your progress to others — every labor begins differently. Keep in close contact with your provider."

The brain continues growing at a fast pace, gaining about 30% in mass during the last four weeks, and this development will continue well into infancy. The baby’s skin is no longer translucent, and fat continues to develop, especially around the cheeks and limbs, giving your baby that adorable chubby appearance. The umbilical cord is about 20 inches long and half an inch thick. At this stage, the placenta is providing antibodies that will help protect your baby’s immune system after birth. The bones in the skull are soft and unfused to allow flexibility during delivery. Your baby is ready — just waiting for the perfect time to meet you.",
            momTipText: "Your body is in final preparation mode, and it can feel like an emotional roller coaster. You might feel ready one moment and nervous the next. Many women feel intense pelvic pressure, lower back pain, or frequent contractions that may start to form patterns — a sign labor could be near. You might experience diarrhea, increased discharge, or an uptick in nesting energy. Your cervix could already be dilated, effaced, or still closed — and all of these are normal. If you’re feeling exhausted, give yourself permission to rest. If you’re restless, keep up gentle movement. At your prenatal visits, your provider will check for fetal position, amniotic fluid levels, and signs of impending labor. Keep an eye out for signs like your water breaking, regular contractions that intensify, or bloody show. You are almost there."

Your baby weighs about 7.5 to 8 pounds (3.4 to 3.6 kg) and is around 20.5 to 21 inches (52–53.3 cm) long — about the size of a small pumpkin. Most of the lanugo (fine body hair) is gone, and only a small amount of vernix may remain. Your baby's organs are fully developed, and the lungs are secreting surfactant to help with the transition to breathing air. The fingernails and toenails may now reach the fingertips. The skull bones are still soft and not yet fused to allow for flexibility during birth. While the baby is completely developed, the placenta is still supplying oxygen and nutrients. Baby may be in a very low position, ready to descend into the birth canal when labor begins. Don’t worry if labor hasn’t started yet — only about 5% of babies are born on their actual due date.",
            momTipText: "You've made it to the final week! At this point, you might feel extremely impatient, uncomfortable, and exhausted. Every movement may feel like a chore, and you may be feeling strong Braxton Hicks or even real contractions if labor is beginning. Pelvic pressure and lightning crotch can be intense as the baby presses on nerves. Sleep is difficult, you may feel clumsy, and you may experience an increase in discharge or mucus. You're likely attending weekly appointments where your cervix is being checked. You may be offered membrane stripping or scheduled for an induction if you go beyond 41 weeks. Emotionally, it can feel like a waiting game, but trust that your body knows what to do. Stay hydrated, rest, and focus on mental preparation for labor. Your incredible journey is about to reach a beautiful turning point."
